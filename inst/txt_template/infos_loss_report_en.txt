# Information loss analysis

Anonymization, also known as Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC), is a crucial data processing procedure designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. This process involves applying various statistical techniques to protect individual identities and other sensitive attributes within the dataset. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the application of these SDC methods often results in a reduction of the overall usefulness of the microdata, a phenomenon referred to as 'information loss.'

To comprehensively evaluate and quantify this information loss, various assessment methods are employed. The choice of assessment method depends on the nature of the quasi-identifiers present in the dataset, which can be either categorical or numeric in nature.

**Information loss assessment for categorical quasi-identifiers**

* Number of missing value introduced during anonymization
* Khi-2 coefficient between categorical variables



**Information loss assessment for numeric quasi-identifiers**

* percentage change of average/total
* Whethr or not the value lay withing the confidence interval
* Correlation between continous variables


The following sections contain the application of these information loss assessment on the anonymized datasets.
